### Make Better Apps

_tl;dr - Make better apps faster with Android Jetpack._

I could explain Android Jetpack at a high level, but I'll let the Google marketing team take care of it:
"Jetpack is a collection of Android software components to make it easier for you to develop great Android apps. These components help you follow best practices, free you from writing boilerplate code, and simplify complex tasks, so you can focus on the code you care about."

Sounds great, right?  But what exactly are these components?  They're collections of libraries, separate from the platform APIs, which we can bring into our apps as we wish.  Each component can be added separately as needed without worry about which version of Android our users are on.

We'll cover all four types of components (Foundation, Architecture, Behavior, and UI) and focus on key pieces like ViewModels and Room.
