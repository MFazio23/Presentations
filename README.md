## Android 6 Marshmallow - What You Need to Know
Android 6.0, codenamed _Marshmallow_, was officially announced on September 29th and rolled out to devices in the next few months.  What do you need to know? Why should you care?  While Marshmallow seems at first glance to be a minor update, a number of features are being introduced that will improve users' experiences with the phone.  Come hear how permissions have changed, how "Doze" will improve your battery life, and how SD cards have become useful once again.

## Android Jetpack - Make Better Apps
_tl;dr: Make better apps faster with Android Jetpack._
I could explain Android Jetpack at a high level, but I'll let the Google marketing team take care of it:
"Jetpack is a collection of Android software components to make it easier for you to develop great Android apps. These components help you follow best practices, free you from writing boilerplate code, and simplify complex tasks, so you can focus on the code you care about."

Sounds great, right?  But what exactly are these components?  They're collections of libraries, separate from the platform APIs, which we can bring into our apps as we wish.  Each component can be added separately as needed without worry about which version of Android our users are on.

We'll cover all four types of components (Foundation, Architecture, Behavior, and UI) and focus on key pieces like ViewModels and Room.
