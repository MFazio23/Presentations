![Android binding](img/android-binding.png)
Notes:
+ Enable in Gradle file
+ View Binding 
    + Generates binding classes to allow for type-safe component references
    + Good replacement for `findViewById()` calls
+ Data Binding
    + Write binding expressions in XML to handle data
    + Send variables into XML
    + Heavier, more full-featured, slower to compile
