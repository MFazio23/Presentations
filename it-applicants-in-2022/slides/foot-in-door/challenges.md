Notes:
+ Sometimes places just won't like your resume
+ Plenty of companies only want senior developers
  + Don't have the infrastructure in place to support junior devs
  + Don't want to take the time
+ Some see entry level as 1-3 years of experience
  + Apply anyway
+ It's hard, it's not just you
