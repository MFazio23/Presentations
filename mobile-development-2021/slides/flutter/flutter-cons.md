# Flutter
## Negatives

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around;">
    <img src="img/flutter-logo-notext.svg" height="300" />

  <ul>
    <li class="fragment spaced-item" data-fragment-index="0">Not Quite Native</li>
    <li class="fragment spaced-item" data-fragment-index="1">Dart</li>
    <li class="fragment spaced-item" data-fragment-index="2">Library Support</li>
  </ul>
</div>

Note:
- Beautiful widgets, but not quite the same as the native controls
- Dart is fine, but less well known or used.
- Less support for some native features or third party libraries
