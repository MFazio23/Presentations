Notes:
- New projects will likely use the current architecture
- There's a "New Architecture" that's available as well
- In progress since 2018
- Planned to be the default by end of 2024.
- "For most production apps, we do not recommend enabling the New Architecture today."
- Faster JS/Native interfacing
- Better layout and rendering
