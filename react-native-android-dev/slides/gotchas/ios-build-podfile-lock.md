Notes:
- Cocoapods is a dependency manager for iOS projects
- Usually don't have to mess with it too much directly
  - Update your `package.json` and RN should autolink
- But if you delete your `Podfile.lock`, you could end up with slightly different versions of dependencies
- Heads up in case you didn't change anything (or think you did)
